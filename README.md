Hi. I'm Steve Fram. Want to learn more about the meaning behind fukubukuro? Have a look at [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fukubukuro). Though, honestly, I was inspired by the fine folks at [meh.com](https://meh.com/). I am in no way affiliated with them. I'm just a fan. But anyhow, the thought of my github account being comprised of a random grab bag of stuff seemed pretty apropos, so there you have it. Cheers!
